# Google Places Categorizer

This tool makes it easy to get data from the google places API, as well as enrich it with other categories of interest. It also provides a match of the existing categories in the data with the fourth-level categories from the Yelp database.

## üíª Prereqs:

To get started make sure you meet the following requirements:

* Python environment - Version 3.7.4+

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install:

To install `Google Places Categorizer` you need clone the follow repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:FerGubert/google_places_categorizer.git
```

Create the `.env` file with your google places API key, as indicated in the `.env.example`.

After then do you need install environment:

```
pip install .
```

## üöÄ Run:

This tool provides two different flows, the flow you want to run must be passed as an argument when executing the main. Below are the details of each flow.

### Calculate Coordinates

This flow generates a csv file with the geographic coordinates of a rectangular area and according to a predetermined step in meters.

First, it is necessary to set the variables described below in the file `config.py`:

* NORTHEAST_LAT, NORTHEAST_LON: indicates the extreme northeast of the area.
* SOUTHWEST_LAT, SOUTHWEST_LON: indicates the extreme southwest of the area.
* RADIUS: indicates the radius of reach for each coordinate that is created within the area.

Then you must pass the argument that indicates this flow when executing the file `main.py`:

```
python src/main.py --flow coordinates
```

The calculated coordinates will be available in `data/output/lat_lon_calculated.csv`.

### Request Google Places API

This flow performs requests to the google places API, according to the geographic coordinates defined in the input file and a predetermined radius. It enriches the data according to the categories also defined in the input file and handles the return of the api, making the data available in a csv file.

First, it is necessary to set the variable described below in the file `config.py`:

* RADIUS: indicates the range for each coordinate that will be used in the request.

It is also necessary to provide in `data/input` a csv file with the geographic coordinates that will be used in the request, as indicated in the `lat_lon.csv` file. 

If you want to enrich the data obtained from the google places API with more specific categories, a csv file with the desired categories must be made available in the same path or use the categories of the fourth hierarchical level of the Yelp base already available in `/data/input/categories.csv`.

Then you must pass the argument that indicates this flow when executing the file `main.py`:

```
python src/main.py --flow request
```

The processed data will be available in `data/output/establishments.csv`.
